Sass also allows us to perform mathematical functions to compute measurementsâ€” including colors.

Here is how Sass computes colors:

The operation is performed on the red, green, and blue components.
It computes the answer by operating on every two digits.
$color: #010203 + #040506;
The above would compute piece-wise as follows:

01 + 04 = 05
02 + 05 = 07
03 + 06 = 09
and compile to:

color: #050709;
Sass arithmetic can also compute HSLA and string colors such as red and blue.

Try it. Add red and blue to make the font color of .math purple the following property:

color: red + blue;
