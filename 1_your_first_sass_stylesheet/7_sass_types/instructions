There are different data types you can assign to a variable in CSS.

In addition to the color data type we have seen, there are also:

Numbers, such as 8.11, 12, and 10px. Notice that while 10 has a unit of px associated with it, it is still considered a number.
Strings of text, with and without quotes. Some examples are "potato", 'tomato', span.
Booleans, or simply true and false.
null, which is considered an empty value.

In main.scss, make a variable of type number at the top of your file:

$icon-square-length: 300px;
Add the following inside the class selector .icon:

width: $icon-square-length;
height: $icon-square-length;
Click "Run" to see your changes in the browser and inspect output in main.css.
