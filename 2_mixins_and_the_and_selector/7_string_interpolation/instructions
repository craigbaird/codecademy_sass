In Sass, string interpolation is the process of placing a variable string in the middle of two other strings.

In a mixin context, interpolation is handy when you want to make use of variables in selectors or file names. The notation is as follows:

@mixin photo-content($file) {
  content: url(#{$file}.jpg); //string interpolation
  object-fit: cover;
}

//....

.photo { 
  @include photo-content('titanosaur');
  width: 60%;
  margin: 0px auto; 
  }
String interpolation would enable the following CSS:

.photo { 
  content: url(titanosaur.jpg);
  width: 60%;
  margin: 0px auto; 
}
1.
In main.scss, edit the photo-content mixin as follows:

@mixin photo-content($file) {
  content: url(#{$file}.jpg); 
  object-fit: cover;
}
Include the mixin inside the .photo selector and pass in a file name of 'titanosaur':

.photo {
        @include photo-content('titanosaur');
        width: 60%;
        margin: 0px auto;  
 }
