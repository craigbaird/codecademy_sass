Mixin arguments can be assigned a default value in the mixin definition by using a special notation.

A default value is assigned to the argument if no value is passed in when the mixin is included. Defining a default value for each argument is optional.

The notation is as follows:

@mixin backface-visibility($visibility: hidden) {
   backface-visibility: $visibility;
  -webkit-backface-visibility: $visibility;
  -moz-backface-visibility: $visibility;
  -ms-backface-visibility: $visibility;
  -o-backface-visibility: $visibility;
}
In the example above, if no value is passed in when backface-visibility is included, hidden would be assigned to all properties.
1.
In main.scss add a default value of hidden to the argument in backface-visibility:

@mixin backface-visibility($visibility: hidden) {
  // Backface properties
}
Inside of .font, .back remove the argument you previously passed to backface-visibility.
