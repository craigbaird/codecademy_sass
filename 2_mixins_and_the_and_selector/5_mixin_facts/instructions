In general, here are 5 important facts about arguments and mixins:

Mixins can take multiple arguments.
Sass allows you to explicitly define each argument in your @include statement.
When values are explicitly specified you can send them out of order.
If a mixin definition has a combination of arguments with and without a default value, you should define the ones with no default value first.
Mixins can be nested.
Here are some concrete examples of the rules:

@mixin dashed-border($width, $color: #FFF) {
  border: {
     color: $color;
     width: $width;
     style: dashed;
  }
}

span { //only passes non-default argument
    @include dashed-border(3px);
}

p { //passes both arguments
    @include dashed-border(3px, green);
}

div { //passes out of order but explicitly defined
   @include dashed-border(color: purple, width: 5px); 
}
In the example above, the color of the border of span elements would be white, the border of paragraph elements would be green, while the div elements would have a thicker purple border.

Practice makes perfect! In main.scss inside of the .back selector, include the following:

@include transform(rotatey(-180deg));
Click "Run" to see your changes in the browser and inspect them in the output of main.css.
2.
In addition to flipping the back, we also want to make sure that the notecard preserves a 3D effect during all of its transformations. At the top of main.scss, add the following mixin:

@mixin transform-style($style){
   transform-style: $style;
  -moz-transform-style: $style;
  -o-transform-style: $style;
  -ms-transform-style: $style;
  -webkit-transform-style: $style;
}
Invoke the mixin inside of .notecard, add the following:

@include transform-style(preserve-3d);
Click "Run" to see your changes in the browser and inspect them in the output of main.css.
3.
Last but not least, add the following at the top of main.scss:

@mixin transition($time){
  transition: $time;
  -webkit-transition: $time;
  -moz-transition: $time;
  -o-transition: $time;
}
Add the following inside the .notecard selector:

@include transition(0.4s);
Click "Run" to see your changes in the browser and inspect them in the output of main.css.
